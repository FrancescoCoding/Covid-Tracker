# Covid-Tracker-Ionic-md-iOS ðŸ¦ ðŸ˜·
Simple app that allows the user to track the current number of COVID cases, recovered, and deaths, in most existing country and regions.

## Technologies Used
This app was build with HTML5, CSS3, vanilla JavaScript, and the Ionic Framework.
To retrieve the current COVID information, some other technologies included in the project are:

- Handling mobile differences between Android and iOS
- Created a customized dark mode and related toggle
- Fetched images dynamically according to each country from the Unsplash API
- Fetch API
- Promises (with async & await)
- Classes handling
- Error handling
- Local storage handling
- Unit testing

A public COVID-19 API was used to retreive the latest information: https://covid-api.mmediagroup.fr/v1/cases.

## Challenges
This project has allowed me to learn yet another popular mobile framework.
It was fun to go back to vanilla JavaScript and not having to use React for once.
The only challenge I found was optimizing the nested Ionic lists and making sure that every country and exception was properly validated.
