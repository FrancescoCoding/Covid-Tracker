# Covid Tracker created with the Ionic Framework for Android and iOS. ðŸ¦ ðŸ˜·
Simple app that allows the user to track the current number of COVID cases, recovered, and deaths, in most existing countries and regions.

A public COVID-19 API is used to retrieve the latest information: https://covid-api.mmediagroup.fr/v1/cases

## Technologies Used
This app was built with **_HTML5_**, **_CSS3_**, vanilla **_JavaScript_**, and the **_Ionic_** Framework.
To retrieve the current COVID information, some other technologies and skills included in the project are:

- Handling mobile differences between Android and iOS
- Apache Cordova
- Created a customized dark mode and related toggle
- Fetched images dynamically according to each country from the Unsplash API
- Fetch API
- Promises (async & await)
- Classes handling
- Error handling
- Local storage handling
- Unit testing

## Challenges
This project has allowed me to learn yet another popular mobile framework.
It was fun to go back to vanilla JavaScript and not to have to use React for once.
The only challenge I found was optimizing the nested Ionic lists and making sure that every country and exception was properly validated. Other than that, I really enjoyed working with Ionic and will be using it in the future.
